## Understanding Timeato branch structure
### Permanent Branches:
#### Main
  - This branch is reserved for tested versions of our code-base. <ins>Do not</ins> make a PR directly into this branch, as we require testing before we can confirm any collection of features.

#### Test
  - This branch is used to test a collection of newly added features, which will eventually become a future iteration of our application after thoroughly testing for bugs and code/guideline consistency. If you are interested in creating your own feature, we suggest that you first open an issue here: https://github.com/devv-work/timeato/issues and wait for our team to respond to your message and approve the implementation. If you are interested in taking responsibility for the implementation, please assign yourself to the issue once you submit it, so that our team can note your interest.


## Creating an Issue

If you encounter a bug and/or have any suggestions for our team, please visit our [issues page](https://github.com/devv-work/timeato/issues) and create a new issue. If you wish to implement a feature on your own, please add yourself as an assignee to the issue you create, so that we can note your interest. When creating an issue, please attempt to outline in detail the topic of the issue, and a thorough description of what the issue attempts to solve. 

If you have encountered a bug, please provide as much information as you can to help us replicate the issue on our own end. Depending on the issue, it may be useful to communicate your browser, screen width, and/or anything that relates to your specific encounter.


## How to make a contribution

If you want to help us improve our app, please fork the repo and follow these steps before creating a pull request.

1. Visit [our Issues](https://github.com/devv-work/timeato/issues) page to check if an issue exists and does not yet have an assignee. Assign yourself to the issue if you find what you are planning to solve.
2. Fork the Project
3. Clone your fork on your local device. The link can be found under the code drop-down at the base of your fork (`git clone <link here>`)
4. Switch to test branch (`git checkout test`)
5. Add a `.env` file to the config folder, and add local environment variables. (`DB_STRING = <mongodb uri>` and `SESSION_SECRET = <choose a random string value>`)
6. Create a new branch for your Feature (`git branch AmazingFeature`)
7. Switch to the branch you are working on (`git checkout AmazingFeature`)
8. Make your changes, commit after every isolated task.
9. Add all of your changes (`git add <file name here>` or `git add .`). Do not push any changes to dependencies unless the Issue calls for it.
10. Commit your changes with a detailed description (`git commit -m 'Feat: added a, solved b, etc...'`)
11. Push to the Branch (`git push origin AmazingFeature`)
12. Open a Pull Request and follow the rules under "Where should I make my pull request to?"

### Workflow after setup

1. `git status` to see your working branch
2. `git pull`
3. `git branch <featureName>`
4. `git checkout <featureName>`
5. Make changes to files/feature
6. `git add .`
7. `git commit -m "message"`
8. `git push --set-upstream origin <featureName>` (On first commit)

## How often should I stage changes?

We require that you stage your changes for each section of code you develop. <ins>Do not</ins> stage changes with a single large commit, or we will close your pull request and/or request changes. We would like you to make commits for every isolated task you complete in your code and avoid working through multiple files when possible. Your commit message should include a detailed view of the work you are implementing and the issue you are solving.


## Where should I make my pull request to?

<ins>Never make a pull request into our main branch</ins>. If you plan on adding a feature, wait until you have completely finished that feature and then make a pull request into "test" with a clear description of the issue you are solving.
